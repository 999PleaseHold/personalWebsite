      <h2>About this website</h2>
      <p>This website was coded entirely by me from scratch as a way to showcase my skills and abilities in HTML and CSS (which I am still learning). Furthermore, I will use this website to host and showcase projects I have worked on - such as my extensive list of past projects in Lua and Python.</p>
      <p1>As you can tell, I am not a web-designer. My interest lies in CyberSec and Programming and less in design.</p1>
    
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I have a strong interest for Computer Science, as evident by my choices in school subjects <i>(GCSE & A-Level Computer Science)</i> as well as Mathematics <i>(which I also take at A-Level)</i>. <br><br>My passon for these subjects extends beyond the classroom, I enjoy exploring coding challenges through LeetCode and other online platforms in languages I have experience in, such as <b>Python</b> and <b>Lua</b>. I also enjoy 3D modelling, and have managed to do freelance work as a 3D Modeller for a few individual clients since I was 15. <br><br>Currently, I am learning <b>cyber security</b>, an industry/subject that fascinates me through it's dynamic nature and critical importance in today's interconnected world. I am doing this through numerous online resourches such as <b>HackTheBox</b> and <b>TryHackMe</b>, completing courses and attempting CTF challenges which advance in difficulty as I progress.<br><br>Outside of computer science, my interests expand into aviation, as I have been flying as part of my <b>private pilot's license</b> for the past 2 years, in which I am working towards completing and finishing my license this year. </p>
